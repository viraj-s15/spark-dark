# <b> Spark Dark </b>

## Have been wanting to create a vscode theme since a while now. Something that is easy on the eyes while being extremely vibrant and providing a sufficient amount of eye candy. This is mostly a result of me not being able to find a suitable theme. The "Ayu" set of themes do come very close though, I highly recommend those. I would not mind expanding this in the future, if you feel like you have a theme that would fit well within my constraints, lemme know.
